# Item Catalog #
This is a item catalog built with Flask, It allows authenticated users to add
and delete items from the catalog. Users will also be able to add new categories. To run the program you first need to have Flask, and sqlite.
The ORM being used is sqlalchemy. To start run the command:
 `python database_setup.py`, then optionally if you want the database to be
 populated run `python database_populater.py`, finally run `python project.py`. If all dependencies are installed the program will be running on 127.0.0.1:5000.
